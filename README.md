# Santa Paravia e Fiumaccio (Web Version)
Web Game inspired by the classic BASIC game Santa Paravia e Fiumaccio.

The original BASIC game for the TRS-80 was created by George Blank (1978) and published on [SoftSide Magazine](https://archive.org/details/softside-magazine-03/page/n7/mode/2up?view=theater).

This Javascript implementation is mostly based on the [C implementation by Thomas Knox](https://github.com/darkf/paravia/blob/master/paravia.c) (2000).

I have kept the game interaction mechanics, but the UI and look & feel have been redesigned.
